Licensor:             ToolPlex LLC
Licensed Work:        ToolPlex Client, as published in this repository. The Licensed Work is (c) 2025
                      ToolPlex LLC.
Additional Use Grant: You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided
                      your use does not involve offering it or derivative works on a 
                      hosted or embedded basis to compete with ToolPlex's paid platform 
                      or services. For purposes of this license:

                      A "competitive offering" is a product or service that is offered 
                      to third parties on a paid basis (including through paid support), 
                      and that significantly overlaps with ToolPlex's platform, including: 
                      tool discovery, tool execution, agent control, or workflow/playbook 
                      reuse.

                      "Product" means software made available to end users or used to 
                      operate hosted services.

                      "Embedded" includes incorporating source or binary components of 
                      the Licensed Work into another product or requiring the Licensed 
                      Work for that product to function.

                      "Internal use" within your organization is permitted, even for 
                      commercial purposes, as long as it is not redistributed or offered 
                      to others.

                      "API Integration Restrictions": Use of the ToolPlex API or services 
                      to build, enhance, or operate a competitive offering is prohibited, 
                      regardless of whether the Licensed Work is directly incorporated.

                      "Derivative Works": Includes any modification, adaptation, or custom 
                      implementation based on the Licensed Work, including but not limited 
                      to custom clients for ToolPlex API interaction. While permitted under 
                      this license, such derivatives may present technical challenges and 
                      are not officially supported.

                      "Research and Academic Use": Non-commercial research, educational, 
                      and academic use is permitted regardless of competitive overlap, 
                      provided results are not used to develop commercial competitive 
                      offerings.

                      "Official Client Recommendation": While custom clients are permitted 
                      under this license, ToolPlex strongly recommends using the official 
                      client to ensure compatibility, security, and optimal performance.

                      Hosting or using the Licensed Work for internal purposes within an 
                      organization is not considered a competitive offering. ToolPlex 
                      considers your organization to include all of your affiliates under 
                      common control.
